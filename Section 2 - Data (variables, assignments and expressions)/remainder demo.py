print(30 % 20) # displays 10 because 30 divided by 20 leaves a remainder of 10

print(9 % 4)   # displays 1 because 9 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1

print(9 % 5)   # displays 4 because 9 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 4

print(12 % 5)  # displays 2 because 12 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2

print(5 % 12)  # displays 5 because 5 divided by 12 leaves a remainder of 5
